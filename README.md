# 🎧 Queue FM

**Queue FM** is a Spotify-powered radio station system that maintains a single, continuously updated playlist. It offers both automated playlist management through [spotify-dj](https://github.com/splinesreticulating/spotify-dj) and manual control via [spotify-jukebox](https://github.com/splinesreticulating/spotify-jukebox).

## 🧰 Components

- **[spotify-dj](https://github.com/splinesreticulating/spotify-dj)**: Automatically curates and updates the playlist based on predefined criteria.
- **[spotify-jukebox](https://github.com/splinesreticulating/spotify-jukebox)**: Allows users to manually add and manage tracks in the playlist.
